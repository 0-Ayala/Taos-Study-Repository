# Taos-Study-Repository
Here you are fellow bootcamers! Upload your notes here.

# What this repository is all about!
This is where bootcampers can find notes and resources compiled by other current and former bootcampers. This repository is mainly used for note sharing purposes. Working code will not be kept here unless it is an example that is directly relevant to any one of the certifications. ..

Use this repository to add whatever you found helpful to the pool of resources. Remember, when we work as a team we build better together! No one bootcamper stands alone facing a certification or engagement. Let this repository be part of your network to further your growth as a Junior DevOps Engineer and as a contributor to the culture of Taos.

## Rules for submitting notes
1. Keep things professional!
..+ No confusing jargon. Abreviations must be clearly written out in full at the first mention within teh document. Readers must be able to tell that the abbreviation correlates to its full name.
..+ Refrain from swearing.
..+ Do not use notes to call out another bootcamper, organization, or tool. If you are comparing tools then your commentary should be as objective as possible.
1. You must download/clone the repository to your machine and place your notes in the proper folder.
1. You must include a README.md file with your notes explaining what they are for, where you took the notes from, and how a user should read the notes. Include any other information that you find relevant in these notes.
1. If your notes are in a link you will have to put the link in the LINKS folder. This is best practice for people who are using Google Drive or another storage service while their notes are being edited.  __YOU SHOULD EVENTUALLY PUT YOUR _NOTES_, NOT THE LINKS, IN THE RELEVANT CERTIFICATION FOLDER OTHERWISE FUTURE USERS MAY NOT FIND WHERE THE NOTES ARE.__ The entire purpose of this repository is so that future bootcampers will have more recently updated resources to help them gain certifications. GitHub is a great resource to share public resources so we should utilize it as such.
..+ __If you are not okay with your notes being publicly shared then do not submit to this repository.__
..+ Your notes are the most important resource for this repository. __Notes should live here. Links should not be to your notes, otherwise that defeats the entire purpose of the repo.__ Your links should be to extra information that someone else has written, helpful diagrams, and other relevant external resources.
1. You must submit a pull request before your notes are merged.
..+ Two or more people must review your notes to make sure that they are usable and meet the above guidelines.
..+ If your changes are rejected you will have comments with reasons why your changes were not accepted. Read the comments and check them off as you fix what the reviewers have suggested.
...+ If you need more clarification you can respond to comments on GitHub with your questions.

## Spot something wrong with someone's notes?
1. First and foremost, issues are meant to improve resources for everyone. Before you submit an issue make sure that you are doing it because it will have a positive impact and improve ease of access, context, ambiguity, or organization. __DO NOT SUBMIT ISSUES TO BE NIT PICKY OR TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT ANOTHER BOOTCAMPER.__ We all want real value here. If you have an issue with another bootcamper the appropriate course of action would be to talk to the program manager and/or HR if needed.
1. The best way to suggest edits to notes is to use GitHub Issues. GitHub Issues help moderators track progress on concerns.
1. First and foremost you should make sure that the issue you have will improve the notes. Examples of issues are:
..+ Spelling mistakes
..+ Ambiguous abbreviations
..+ Confusing explanations
..+ Out of date information
..+ Resources are in the wrong path
1. If an issue is unclear you should ask for clarification. Be specific when you ask for clarification. The more context you add to an issue the quicker it will be solved.
1. If your issue is deemed irrelevant, unhelpful, or antagonistic moderators will close the issue.

## Want to submit code or other non-documentation resources?
1. Before you start writing code you should ask the repository managers if your code is relevant that way you don't spend time coding only to have your files rejected because they don't meet the needs of the repository.
..+ Due to the nature of this request processing time may take a little longer than reviewing notes. Send a message to the reviewers/managers over Slack if you have a question about the timeliness of the code reveiew process.
1. We will attempt to check for convention, correctness, readability, and usefulness to the bets of our abilities. If you spot something that should be changed or implemented better please open an issue.
1. Remember that your code must in some way help bootcampers prepare for their certifications and/or engagements. Submitting project starter code, example projects, problem/solution case studies, and scripts is fully encouraged.

## Reviewing changes before merges
1. Absolutely everything must be reviewed before it is merged. If something is merged without approval of two or more reviewers then the change will be rolled back.
1. Make sue to choose at least two people to review your code. Make sure they know you requested them as reviewers.
..+ Make sure your reviewers know you requsted that they review your changes by messaging them.
...+ Follow up on your messages and make sure the message has been recieved, read, and understood.
..+ If someone does not agree to be your reviewer you can select another bootcamper or a manager.
