Hello everyone! I just wanted to curate a short list of some of the best resources that I used over the past 12+ months to learn from as I transitioned my career from science to technology. Much of the content is focused on DevOps but I have added some of my favorite resources which mostly entail WebDev (CSS/JS/Ruby/WordPress) as that is my background. Please feel free to add to it and to help with organization into sections and sub sections for clarity and content. Thanks!
